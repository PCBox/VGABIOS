# LGPL'd VGABios for Bochs and QEMU

The goal of this project is to have a LGPL'd Video Bios in Bochs and QEMU.
This VGA Bios is very specific to the emulated VGA card.
It is NOT meant to drive a physical vga card.

The Cirrus SVGA extension is designed for the Cirrus emulation in Bochs and
QEMU. The initial patch for the Cirrus extension has been written by Makoto
Suzuki (suzu).


# Voodoo Banshee PCI extension

Some parts of the initial version are based on the Cirrus extension code.
